// Number2
// The people at the Hoover Dam have called you back, and would like a file that shows what happens when just the even numbered turbines are turned on. Furthermore, they want it all in just one for-loop. (They tend to micromanage.)
//
// With a set of complex conditional statements, construct a way inside the loop to only turn on even numbered turbines today. Remember our power output situation, too: generators 1-4 produce 62 MW and generators 5-19 produce 124 MW. The output format should be as follows:
//
// Generator #1 is off.
// Generator #2 is on, adding 62 MW, for a total of 62 MW!
// Weâ€™ve given you some starting variables to use in your build. Within your loop, consider the 3 possible scenarios when building your conditions:
//
// The Generator is off
// The Generator provides 62 MW of power
// The Generator provides 124 MW of power
